Description: This package provides functionality to fit piecewise cubic splines
    to model the relationship between a univariate 'X' and a univariate 'Y' as
    well as to use the fitted spline models to make predictions based on new 
    'X' data. The canonical use case is for predicting hourly electric demand
    from hourly temperature given one or more years of data. The package models
    the relationship between these two variables as the sum of: 1) an aggregate
    relationship between daily average 'X' and daily average 'Y', and 2) 
    monthly intra-day patterns represented as hourly offsets from the daily
    average 'Y'. The spline functionality is used for learning a robust 
    aggregate relationship without the inconvenience of manual feature 
    engineering and with higher capacity than linear regression. The model 
    fitting workhorse is R's built-in 'smooth.spline'. This package provides 
    a suite of options for controlling how 'smooth.spline' fits a spline to 
    the data. In particular, it is designed to return a model with a single 
    critical point to ensure that changes in predicted electric demand are 
    always positive as temperatures become more extreme.
